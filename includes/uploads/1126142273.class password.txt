veracrypt:

vulnerabilities :01:password stored in plaintext inside the program
=>notepad+esiea_lourd.exe => search for "master password"
2) password printed on the screen while typing.
03)database login/password stored in clear text in config file 
=>DBVisualizer =>reuse the info from config.ini : the best solution for this to move to a 3-tier
architecture or use solution like CITRIX.

04)Bad profile /privialges segregation =>from agent profile to admin option 

05)technical information leakage:=>option3=> changing the password prints in the sql query


06)sql injection:in the login process
07)arbitary system commands execution=> option 2=>localhost && type config.ini
 08) password stored in memory are never deleted/overwritten
    => HxD hex editor => Open Memory => CTRL+F => PwnMeHaxor


look for the CITRICE
if you want to delete the information first u have to overwrite the data with arbitary values and u delete (it means free the memory ).

actual notes 
Vulnerabilities :
01- password stored in plaintext inside the program
    => notepad + esiea_lourd.exe => search for "Master password 

:"
02- password printed to the screen while typing
03- database login/passwords stored in cleartext in config file
    => DBVisualizer => reuse the info from config.ini
    => to fix this vulnerability, the best solution is to move 

to a 3-tier architecture or use solutions like Citrix
04- bad profile/privileges segregation
    => from agent profile, admin options are accessible (option 

3 and 4)
05- technical information leakage
    => option 3 => changing the password prints the SQL query
06- SQL Injection
    => in the login process
SELECT priv FROM users WHERE username = "aaa" AND password = "bbb"
SELECT priv FROM users WHERE username = "admin" => works
SELECT priv FROM users WHERE username = "admin" AND password = 

"bbb" => fail
SELECT priv FROM users WHERE username = "admin#" AND password = 

"bbb" => fail because the " is not closed
SELECT priv FROM users WHERE username = "admin"#" AND password = 

"bbb"
SELECT priv FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'#' AND password = 

"bbb"

Comments in SQL: -- or # or /* XXX */

07- Arbitrary system commands execution
    => option 2 => localhost && type config.ini
08- password stored in memory are never deleted/overwritten
    => HxD hex editor => Open Memory => CTRL+F => PwnMeHaxor

WinZip => 2.000.000 passwd/sec
WinRar => 100 passwd/sec


Password Managers applications => KeyChain for Mac OS X, MyKi (??? 

/ mobile app + desktop), 
QWERTY CARD => helps to generate sub-passwords from an initial one
=> KeePass
